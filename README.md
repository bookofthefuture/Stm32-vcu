# Compiling
You will need the arm-none-eabi toolchain: https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
The only external depedencies are libopencm3 and libopeninv. You can download and build this dependency by typing

`make get-deps`

Now you can compile stm32-vcu by typing

`make`

And upload it to your board using a JTAG/SWD adapter, the updater.py script or the esp8266 web interface

I use CodeBlocks IDE :  https://www.codeblocks.org/

Sept 21 : V1 hardware and firmware from "Master" branch now running in my E46 Touring and E39 vehicles.
